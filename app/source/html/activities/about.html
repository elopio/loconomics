                    <h1>About us</h1>  
                    <p>Loconomics is a cooperative of service professionals (massage therapists, dog walkers, florists, you name it) who want to find clients, help clients find them, and support local business—without middlemen or far-off investors.</p>
                    <p>We're not millionaires. We're no big tech company. We're a cooperative, meaning the better one of our owners does, the better all of us do. If you're an independent professional, it's likely that the sharing economy and booking websites have changed the way you do business. Maybe you're kneading backs, maybe you're wrangling dogs, maybe you're painting houses, maybe you're sitting children. Maybe you do all these things and more. Whatever your specialty, we want to create a network and booking platform that puts you first. Rethink the way you're told to run your business: a co-operative model benefits you and the local community.</p>
                    <p>Loconomics joins a long and strong tradition of co-ops in the Bay Area dedicated to the wellbeing of their owners. We're harnessing the power of the internet and the structure of a cooperative so that, as Trebor Shulz says, independent service providers in the sharing economy <a href="http://www.academia.edu/22572831/An_Introduction_to_Platform_Cooperativism" target="_blank" class="text-secondary">“can reap the fruits of their own labor.”</a></p>
                    <p><strong>Loconomics is dedicated to our members, who provide helpful, creative, and meaningful services to the Bay Area and beyond.</strong></p>
                    <h2>Mission</h2>
                    <p>Loconomics Cooperative's mission is to use technology, shared ownership, and community to strengthen local economies.</p>
                    <p>We provide tools, a marketplace, and community to our owners, empowering them to thrive in their work as local service professionals.</p>
                    <p>We provide their clients an app where they can discover and directly book local service professionals safely and easily, without middle-men.</p>
                    <h2>Cooperative Model</h2>
                    <p>From early on, we knew we wanted to be a cooperative, so that we could pool together our backgrounds, resources, and community into a kind of commons—a public utility that our owners could use. David Bollier, a writer we admire for his commitment to the idea of the commons and an “ethical economy,” writes that a commons arises “whenever a group of people decides that it wishes to manage a resource in a collective manner, with a special regard for equitable access…and long-term stewardship.” This is what we're aiming for: a (virtual) place created by and working for our owners.</p>
                    <p>A cooperative structure means that every owner has an equal vote in the election of the Loconomics board and in other major decisions. It also means that the profits generated by Loconomics will be returned to the owners, in proportion to their participation in generating profits. There is also a small team of people working behind-the-scenes on the app and the generalities of Loconomics who, by way of a small monthly fee assessed to owners, will receive capped salaries in order to keep everything running. Pretty simple stuff! And a far cry, we think, from massive corporate booking sites who have no real interest in creating a vital community of member-owners.</p>

                        <p>Tired of climbing a ladder to nowhere? Loconomics is taking a different approach to work. Staff trusteeship is a model of organizational governance that views all staff members of the cooperative as trustees of its mission. Staff trusteeship may emerge as a best practice in the governance of cooperatives with a large and geographically dispersed membership base. While the cooperative exists to benefit its members, it may the full-time staff of the cooperative – not the Board of Directors – that is most capable and available to be directly accountable to the large membership base.</p>    
                        <p>In comparison to staff of conventional businesses and organizations, all staff in a staff trusteeship cooperative have heightened responsibility, and, as such, heightened influence within the cooperative. In order to carry out their heightened responsibilities, each staff member will have relatively equal powers to that of other staff members. Each staff member will have opportunities to influence the activities of the cooperative and to influence their realm of work within the cooperative. The Staff Trustees shall use an internal governance/operational model, such as holacracy, that distributes power among them, ensuring a great deal of agency for each staff member.</p>
