# Verifying licenses and certifications of service professionals

This document outlines the process for verifying required and optional licenses and certifications uploaded by service professionals and how we display them to potential clients.

## Objective
- We want clients to konw that professionals listed on Loconomics have the licenses or certifications required in the area they are offering services. 
- We want to make it easy for service professionals to know whats's required of them and a user-friendly experience to upload what we need to verify their documentation. 
- Loconomics wants to do our best in ensuring a safe experience for all users.
- Please refer to the Loconomics Background Check and License Verification Policy for full details.

### Communicating what's required to service professionals for their job title
- An API call to job-title-licenses will return: 
  - any required licenses for that job title we show in our database for serviceaddresses in their profile (there will be none available until we build a database of licenses)
  - an option for adding any unlisted required licenses
  - an additional option for adding any supplemental certifications
- This information is shown to the service professional under job title certifications/licenses in their job title's marketplace profile (markeplaceJobtitles)

### Process for service professionals to upload documentation
- Service professionals click on "Job title certifications/licenses"
- They click on any required licenses or "Add a required certification/license +" to upload a photo or pdf (future feature) of their license
- They can click on "Add a supplemental certification +" to upload a photo or pdf (future feature) of their license

### Process for service professionals to view/edit licenses/certifications:
- Licenses and certifications will be mapped to a municipality, county, state, or country and be listed under each section
- They can click on the license they want to view or edit
- They can submit a new photo for the selected license

### Viewing a service professional's licenses/certifications:
- An api call to api/v1/en-us/users/publicuserlicenseverification will list all publicly available info for each license a service professional has submitted with a "Confirmed" verification status.
