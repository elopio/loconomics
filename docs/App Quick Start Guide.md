# App Quick Start Guide

## Download or clone the master branch of the Loconomics Github repository
- [Download](https://github.com/loconomics/loconomics/archive/master.zip)
- Cloning link: https://github.com/loconomics/loconomics.git
- [Help with cloning](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)

## Install Node.js

You'll need to [download Node.js v4.6.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or newer (macOS, Windows, Linux) and install on your local machine.
*Note: if a problem is detected when using a newer version of Node, please post errors in [a new issue](https://github.com/joshdanielson/Loconomics/issues/new), we want to support newest versions.*

## Install Grunt globally (from the command line)
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
Note: Linux and Mac may require root/elevated rights in order to install globally. For Mac, try:
```
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```
## Install modules (from the command line in the /app folder of the project directory)
```
npm install
```
It will install all the modules listed on the package.json file, needed to build the app source code.

Note: Linux and Mac may require root/elevated rights in order to install globally. For Mac, try:
```
sudo npm install
```

## Build the app source code

Ensure you're in the project's /app folder and run:
```
grunt build
```
It will recreate the content of the /build and /phonegap folders.

## Start your local host

**Ensure you're in the project's /app folder **

There are two options for this, with the second one preferred:

First option:
```
grunt connect:atbuild
```
Allows you to test the webapp in the browser, a lightweight built-in http server is being used (connect), to start it, run next command and keep the task alive.

Second option (preferred):
```
grunt atwork
```
This will:
- run the connect server at http://localhost:8811/
- run the watch task that will listen for changes on source files to automatically rebuild the needed files (specific builds are performed, like build-js, build-css, depending on the modified files; when they finish, the browser can be refreshed to try latest changes).
  **Important:** the 'watch' task is unable to detect new created files of some types, requiring us to manually restart the 'atwork' task to let detect further changes. Any help fixing this is welcome, at [#1123](https://github.com/joshdanielson/Loconomics/issues/1123).
- by modifying the package.json file, e.g. to update the version number, the watch task will run the grunt build task, rebuilding everything; when it finishs, the /build/latest.zip file is ready to be sent to PhoneGap Build, and the phonegap folder is ready to perform local PhoneGap builds.
- when the build ends, a notification is sent to the system. [More info on this](https://github.com/dylang/grunt-notify)

## Open the app

Open your browser (Chrome preferred) and open:
```
http://localhost:8811/appDebug.html
```
If you see a directory, select appDebug.html to open the app.

The **appDebug.html** available at localhost:8811 contains non-minimized and source mapped files, better for debugging. It's the preferred one for development, while we have an app.html that contains minimized files without source maps that is what we use in production, just in case there are doubts about minimizing options that could break something (not normally) we have this to test and verify.
*Note:* All JS, CSS and HTML is being bundled on single files right now, with the project getting bigger it starts to be a huge load for browsers and debuggers, we have in mind the need to split project files and load them on demand (good for debugging and for webapp load times).

## Point your local storage to a database

At start-up, the app looks for a siteUrl in the config key at localStorage. Since there isn't one set for your localhost, it needs to be set using the html attribute data-site-url. 

### To set up a different REST Service URL:
Open the Web console with the page opened (can be the local development server created by 'grunt atwork', or our Webapp dev.loconomics.com) and replace the data-site-url:

#### For our dev database (ignore security warnings):
```
localStorage["LoconomicsApp/config"] = '{"siteUrl":"http://dev.loconomics.com"}';
```
#### For your local database:

```
localStorage["LoconomicsApp/config"] = '{"siteUrl":"http://localhost/loconomics"}';
```
#### To restore it and have the App/Webapp use the default URL:
```
delete localStorage["LoconomicsApp/config"]
```
