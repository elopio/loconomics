# Contributor Guidelines

## Communications
We prefer to keep all communications in each related Github issue and converse with each other using our @username so that conversations are well documented and stay within the project even if it requires a new issue for it. 

## CSS Naming Conventions

We use Bootstrap as CSS framework and it has it's own naming rules, for anything related to Boostrap (like adding changes, modifiers on top of Bootstrap classes) or files under /utils folder, we follow the simple Boostrap naming.

But for *components* styles, the classes at /components folder that start with uppercase letter, we use [SUIT naming convention](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md)

**Disclaimer**: this rules were not strictly followed in the past or there is code created before we set this rules, then current source code needs some clean-up/refator. New code must follow the rules.

## Changes to the database

Any proposed changes to the database should be made by placing a .sql file in the web/_DBUpdate folder of your branch with the file named with these three attributes:
- issue123 (the branch name) +
- A1 (order of the changes made to the database. Start a new letter if unrelated.) +
- short title (something describing the changes)

### Example
```
issue1076 - A1 - new customertransactiontype table.sql
```

## Use of Github

We use Github to track all user stories, development issues, marketing tasks, project management, product roadmaps, and a repository for for other related project information.

### Adding user stories
We have a repository of user stories for [Service Professionals](/User Stories/User Stories - Service Professionals.md), [Clients](/User Stories/User Stories - Clients.md), and [Cooperatives](/User Stories/User Stories - Cooperatives.md).

#### Step 1: Ensure user story is not already recorded
Review the repositories to see if a user story is already there for the feedback. If it is, add +1 to the counter in the Users Reported column.

#### Step 2: Determine if the story already fits into the repository 
Usually, the feedback can be translated into a Test Case for an existing Child Story or as a Child Story to an existing Epic Story.

#### Step 3: Create user story
Feedback from users should be translated using the [User Story Template](/Agile Templates/User Story.md) to make it actionable into one of three types of stories:
##### Test Case (most common)
##### Child Story (most common)
##### Epic Story (most common)

### Bugs
Before reporting a bug:
* Please have a look in [Known Bugs](https://github.com/dani0198/Loconomics/milestone/74) and the current release folder to see if the bug has already been reported. If so please add any extra, clarifying information you can to the existing issue. 

The first thing we do with a bug report is confirm we can reproduce the bug. Please try to give us enough information so that we can produce the buggy experience ourselves:

Try to include:
* What steps you took just before the bug.
* What you were expecting to happen when the bug happened.
* What actually happened - the buggy behaviour itself.
* What web browser you were using.
* Screen shots.
* UserIDs, BookingIDs, JobTitleIDs involved.
* The /activityName from the URL.
